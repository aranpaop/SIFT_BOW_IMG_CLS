# SIFT_BOW_IMG_CLS
Using SIFT feature of images instead of CNN.
Tried traditional methods to classifier pictures.
Its effect is worse than cnn in my project, maybe other small dataset could help more.
Because it cannot use gpu to train, the parameters reffered to others' are not well considered.
To some extent, it is just for fun.
